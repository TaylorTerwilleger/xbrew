## 🤔 About the Project
xbrew was developed as a way of having a package manager for homebrew (as in video game console homebrew). Currently it only supports importing boilerplate
code for setting up homebrew application development, howerver I plan on integrating it into BrewShop(soon:tm:) for more fun features!

### 🔨 Built With
- GCC
- Make
- Bash
- Git

## 💡 Usage
type `xbrew -h` for feature list [Note: most features won't work yet, as xbrew is very early in development]

### 🧪 Experimental Notice

For now, the project entirely fluid and **can change at any moment**.
do not expect everything to work 100% of the time, if something is broken, please make an issue [here](https://github.com/twert627/xbrew/issues/new)

### 👋 More Info
 
Requires DevKitPro to compile boilerplate code, auto installation coming soon:tm:

### 🌟 Features

- soon:tm:
