<h2 id="about-the-project">🤔 About the Project</h2>
xbrew was developed as a way of having a package manager for homebrew (as in video game console homebrew). Currently it only supports importing boilerplate
code for setting up homebrew application development, howerver I plan on integrating it into BrewShop(soon:tm:) for more fun features!
